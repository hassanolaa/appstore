A modern, high-performance desktop App & Game Store client built with Flutter for Linux systems. This client integrates directly with Flatpak via `libflatpakcli` to enable searching, browsing, installing, managing, and updating desktop applications and games through a visually stunning, glassmorphic UI.

Designed for both traditional desktop usage and couch-gaming setups, the application features native, focus-driven keyboard navigation, smooth micro-animations, and a robust offline fallback system.

## 🏛 Architecture & Technical Design

The codebase implements **Clean Architecture** patterns separated into distinct folders to ensure high testability, maintainability, and loose coupling.

    UI[Presentation / Pages & Widgets] --> Cubit[Cubit State Management]
    Cubit --> Repo[Repository Implementation]
    Repo --> LocalDS[Local Data Source / SQLite]
    Repo --> RemoteDS[Flatpak Data Source / libflatpakcli]
    LocalDS --> DB[(store.db)]
    RemoteDS --> CLI[Subprocess execution]
```

### Key Technologies Stack
* **State Management**: `flutter_bloc` / Cubit for decoupled business logic and reactive UI updates.
* **Dependency Injection**: `get_it` service locator for registering repositories, cubits, and database handlers.
* **Database Caching**: `sqflite_common_ffi` to interact with a bundled database asset (`assets/db/store.db`) containing app catalogs.
* **Functional Programming Utilities**: `dartz` (Either type) for clean, type-safe error handling.
* **Subprocess Communication**: Non-blocking asynchronous process streams (`Process.start` / `Process.run`) interfacing with `libflatpakcli` to run native operations.

## 🛠️ Requirements & System Setup

To build and run the application natively on Linux, ensure you have the following packages installed:

```bash
# Ubuntu / Debian / Pop!_OS
sudo apt update
sudo apt install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev sqlite3 libsqlite3-dev flatpak

# Fedora
sudo dnf install clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config gtk3-devel lzma-devel sqlite-devel flatpak

# Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S clang cmake ninja pkg-config gtk3 sqlite flatpak
```

### Flatpak & CLI Utility
The app relies on `libflatpakcli` for transaction streaming. If the CLI utility is not present on the developer system, `FlatpakDataSourceImpl` automatically shifts to a **simulated mock fallback** (instantly enabling app previews, installation streams, and removal simulations) allowing full UI testing without having Flatpak configurations active.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url> game_store
   cd game_store
   ```

2. **Retrieve dependencies**:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run in development mode (Linux desktop)**:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d linux
   ```

4. **Build the production release bundle**:
   ```bash
   flutter build linux --release
   ```
   The compiled output will be generated under `build/linux/x64/release/bundle/game_store`.

## 🔧 Flatpak Subprocess Integration Details

The client communicates with the background daemon via terminal subprocess streams. When triggering transactions such as installation:
1. It executes `libflatpakcli install system flathub <ref>`.
2. It parses the initial stdout header containing transaction metadata (like dependency resolution JSON).
3. It listens to chunk streams separated by a null byte (`0`) to obtain real-time progress percentages.
4. It catches standard error output and displays clean dialogs if installations fail (e.g. connection lost or missing credentials).

This architecture guarantees that the Flutter UI remains completely responsive and lag-free, regardless of how heavy the Flatpak transaction is.
